## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Download the ZIP** or clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fexhub-theme.git
Open index.html in your browser — no build step required.

Edit the HTML files (e.g., pricing.html) to update content.

Customize branding:

Update --accent, --accent2, --ink, --muted in assets/css/style.css.

Replace the logo blocks with your own logo or text.

Deploy to any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, cPanel, etc.).

🎨 Customization
Colors: controlled via CSS variables in style.css.

Header/Footer: included in every page for consistency.

Images: replace assets/img/demo-*.svg with your brand images.

Content: all texts are demo content, ready to be replaced.

📖 Documentation
Each service (Minecraft, VPS, Web, DNS, etc.) has its own docs page under /docs/.

Use these as templates for your real knowledge base.
